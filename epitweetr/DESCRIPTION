Description: The epitweetr package allows you to automatically monitor trends of tweets by time, place and topic. This automated monitoring aims at early detecting public health threats through the detection of signals or unusual increase of the number of tweets for that time, place and topic. The epitweetr package was designed to focus on infectious diseases and other related health topics, and it can be used for other fields as well modifying the topics.
